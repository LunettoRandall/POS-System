Mac OS X requirements:


_PREREQUISITES_

* All Mac OS X versions automatically come with JAR Launcher

* What is Jar Launcher?
It is the program in Mac OS X that launches Java JAR files into the Aqua/Java runtime environment when the JAR file is double clicked.




_INSTALL POS.JAR PROGRAM_

* Download the POS.jar




_INSTALL THE LATEST JAVA SDK AND JAVAFX_

*Download links here: 
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html
https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#introduction




_RUN POS.JAR PROGRAM_

* Double click the file to launch the application and it should open with 'Jar Launcher' program by default.

** However, if it is FIRST TIME launching the POS application using the Jar Launcher:

- You may have to RIGHT CLICK the POS.jar file	
- Select 'Open With'
- Click 'Jar Launcher'

You will see a Security Pop-Up as our application is not yet recognized by your machine:
- Click ALLOW/ACCEPT

You will see another Security Pop-Up requesting the Jar Launcher to have access to your folder:
- Click ALLOW/ACCEPT




_LOG-IN TO JARC POS SYSTEM_

* Once application is launch, you'll be prompted to enter a USERNAME and PASSWORD:

- Type in user credentials to 'Log In Credentials (case-sensitive):
	USERNAME: Guest
	PASSWORD: Guest




_TROUBLESHOOTING_

In case you double click the application and it doesn't run, or the 'Open With:...Jar Launcher' method doesn't work. 
Please follow the steps below:

* Open your Terminal

- You can't find your Terminal: Press the 'command' button and 'spacebar' at the same time to open 'Spotlight Search':
- Type: 'Terminal' and select the terminal program you want to launch

A terminal window / command line window will open on your screen.


* Type the following command in its entirety then press "Enter":

java -jar "<the application full path or directory>"

- Note: The application full path of directory should look like this (depending on where you've downloaded the POS.jar file):
  " ~/Downloads/POS.jar " OR " ~/Desktop/POS.jar "

_TROUBLESHOOTING_

In case you double click the application and it doesn't run. Please follow the steps below:

* Press the Windows and R buttons at the same time or go to start/windows system/command prompt on a Windows 10 machine. 

- Earlier versions of windows might be different if you don't use the keyboard shortcut.

- If the keyboard shortcut is used, a "Run" dialog box will appear at the lower left corner of your screen.

* Type: "cmd" in the run dialog box and press "Enter".

- A command prompt will popup.

* Type the following command in its entirety then press "Enter":

java -jar "<the application full path or directory>"

- Note: The application full path of directory should look like this:
 "C:\Users\YOURNAME\..........\pos.jar"

- for convenience, you can type the (java -jar) command and drag and drop the application into your command prompt (cmd) window.
